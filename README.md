Analysis of Credit Card Fraud
European credit card holders' recorded 284,807 transactions in the 2-day period of September 2013, 492 of which were fraudulent transactions, accounting for 0.172%. The data are mapped into V1, V2,..., V28 numerical attributes by PCA transformation. Only the two variables of transaction time and amount have not undergone PCA transformation. The output variable is binary variable, 1 is normal and 0 is fraudulent transaction.

3 Loan Default Forecast Competition Data "Kaggle Competition"
Loan Default Forecast Competition Data, which is personal financial transaction data, has passed standardized and anonymous processing. Including nearly 800 attribute variables of 200,000 samples, each of which is independent of each other. Each sample is marked as defaulted or not defaulted, and if it is defaulted, the loss is marked at the same time. The loss is between 0 and 100, which means the loss rate of the loan. The loss rate of non-default is 0, and the default loss of personal loans is predicted and modeled through the attribute variable values of the samples. The data come from Imperial College London.
